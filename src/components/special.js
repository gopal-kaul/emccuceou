                  I was introduced to the amazing world of music quite early in
                  my life. My first teacher was my mother. I started learning
                  Carnatic classical music from her since the age of three.
                  Though I loved singing and lost the sense of the world
                  everytime I sang, I felt uncomfortable in crowd. I was quite
                  shy and was very reluctant to sing when people were around.
                  This changed in my third standard when I participated in the
                  All India Music Competitions for the first time. I was quite
                  nervous and was too young to handle the pressure, midst the
                  song my mind felt blank and my lips went numb, I couldn't
                  complete my song and was not awarded any marks that year.
                  However, it was the most memorable moment. It thought me what
                  pressure was capable of doing. I went back the following year
                  only to win the first prize.That prize took the confidence in
                  me to next level and what followed after was string of prizes
                  in competitions until my tenth class. Hectic academic schedule
                  and never ending weekend tests made sure I wouldn't take music
                  classes anymore atleast for next 2 years. Fast forward to
                  engineering, I resumed my journey and started learning from
                  Shri Kyvalya Kumar Garu, under whom I have cleared the
                  Certificate course in music with distinction. For the year
                  2020-21 I served as the general secretary for the college
                  music club EMC¬≤. Even after being 15 years into music, I am
                  still curious and I wish to acquire as much musical knowledge
                  as I can.

                  Hey, I am Vaishnavi. Here is my story. My music journey
                  started when I was in my second standard, my parents joined me
                  in a music institute nearby my school because there was no one
                  to look after me as both of them had a job, I eventually
                  developed interest in carnatic music, I love listening to all
                  kind of genres, melody being my favorite and music singers
                  like Shreya Ghoshal, Sid Sriram and music directors like A.R.
                  Rahman, M.M Keeravani made me love music even more with their
                  mesmerizing work in the music industry.
