                  I started singing like any average Christian child in church
                  ðŸ˜‚. When I was in 11th grade I started writing poetry which
                  slowly developed into me writing songs and my guitar journey
                  started when I was 12 years old. Currently I had one show for
                  my originals thanks to the music club, was the founder of the
                  open mic in college and currently working on original music to
                  be released soon . Apart from this I am also a part time
                  guitar teacher

                  I started learning carnatic music vocals when I was 7. Back
                  then, I wasn't really into music. But with time, I slowly
                  started developing my interest towards it. Although I had to
                  change my classical carnatic trainers for thrice and had to
                  stop taking the training, I would still love to continue
                  pursuing it. As a child, I didn't really understand the beauty
                  of classical music, but on exploring other genres too growing
                  up, I realised how rich and authentic classical carnatic music
                  is! Apart from Carnatic music, I'd love listening to Sufi
                  songs and Contemporary movie songs. My favourite artists
                  include Ayushmaan Khurrana, Shreya Ghoshal, A.R. Rehman, Sid
                  Sreeram, Rahul Vellal, Chinmayi Sripada, and many more. Coming
                  to the western music, I don't know many artists, as I didn't
                  discover my interests particularly here in the western. But so
                  far, my favourites are- Taylor Swift, Avicii, and Chester
                  Bennington.
                  <br />
                  Talking about my association with the club, I feel totally
                  jubilant to have known the people of the club! It was always
                  enthralling to sing along, rehearse and practice with these
                  fabulous bunch of people! And, there was never a moment off!{" "}
                  <br />
                  Also, the amount of takeaways I had from being a part of
                  sessions of the club, was really great! Because, when you
                  practice with people you get to know enormous details,
                  starting from the scale of the song to the very minute details
                  like the vibrato!
                  <br />
                  EMCC has definitely helped me evolve as a better singer! P.S.
                  I also, started learning to play the guitar and the keyboard
                  (which I stopped learning in my 5th grade :/)

                  My association with music is one of the turning points in my
                  life. When I was a child I was bad at everything (
                  studies,sports etc). During my 4th standard there were few
                  competitions in our school and I had to participate in it as
                  it was compulsory for every one to participate in any one of
                  them. I chose to participate in singing and I won second
                  prize.
                  <br />
                  This helped me to boost my confidence and improve myself. I am
                  not a trained singer but I would love to learn carnatic music
                  and piano. My favourite artists include Anurag Kulkarni, Sid
                  Sriram, Sunitha , Arjith Singh and many more.
                  <br />
                  Emcc helped me a lot in improving my skills.It gave me a
                  chance to perform in many events,chance to meet many good
                  musicians and share the stage with them. I feel excited being
                  part of emcc and looking forward to participating in more
                  events.

                  Hey, I am Vaishnavi. Here is my story. My music journey
                  started when I was in my second standard, my parents joined me
                  in a music institute nearby my school because there was no one
                  to look after me as both of them had a job, I eventually
                  developed interest in carnatic music, I love listening to all
                  kind of genres, melody being my favorite and music singers
                  like Shreya Ghoshal, Sid Sriram and music directors like A.R.
                  Rahman, M.M Keeravani made me love music even more with their
                  mesmerizing work in the music industry.

                  Who doesn't love listening to music?!.. Even though I was a
                  melophile from my childhood. I always used to listen to music
                  and sing in front of my friends without knowing anything about
                  music..just feeling the emotion of the song but I wasn't able
                  to sing with that emotion. When I was in 6th standard, I saw
                  one girl.She was so beautiful and smart as well. I don't know
                  why..I used to feel happy around her. Gradually I fell in love
                  with her. But I didn't have the courage to tell her . So I
                  thought I could express my feelings through music. So I
                  started exploring music and really enjoyed learning little
                  basics .I sang "Naalone pongenu narmada" for her. She loved it
                  and appreciated me . I was on cloud nine. Finally I proposed
                  to her in 10th standard but she told me that she loves someone
                  else. That really destroyed me mentally. I went into
                  depression.Well.. that helped me in one way. After that
                  incident, I was able to sing with emotion. Many people
                  appreciated my voice and my way of singing. She's the main
                  reason behind the 'emotion' in my singing . So yeah!.. that's
                  how I got into music and I'm loving learning it ! Thanks to my
                  first love &lt;3
                  <br />
                  My favourite artists are A.R.Rahman,G.V.Prakash,Armaan malik I
                  listen to almost all genres of music cause I'm a melophile

                  I was seven , when we moved to Gujarat. New place , new
                  language , new culture but my love for the music stayed the
                  same. I started learning hindustani music there and continued
                  to do so until I moved to hyderabad. Though my music teacher
                  taught me in gujarati , language was never a barrier for me to
                  learn music. However, I lacked confidence to perform in front
                  of an audience . I used to just sing in front of my mother,
                  and she kept on forcing me to perform at family gatherings,
                  but I always had an excuse. I've posted a few covers during
                  the pandemic, and the response has boosted my confidence.
                  Since then, I've been an active participant in emcc's events.
                  I listen to a variety of genres but Sid Sriram's and Shawn
                  Mendes songs are what I crave the most!.I'm looking forward to
                  taking part in upcoming events, and I'll surely give it my
                  all!

                  Hey...! I am Shishira. Here is a short glimpse of my music
                  journey. I initiated my musical journey from an early age of
                  mine with the tunes of Carnatic music. To advance my musical
                  interest, I had done a certificate course in Carnatic music
                  from the prestigious Pottisreeramulu Telugu University. I took
                  part in carnatic concerts on the occasion of Sri Ramanavami
                  and Thyagaraja Aradhana. I also extended my Carnatic music
                  interest by participating in the bhajan Samrat event. I love
                  Shreya Ghoshal's voice tone and singing style moving to the
                  cinematic genre. I believe in a quote-
                  <br />
                  <q>
                    Music is the literature of the heart; it commences where
                    speech ends. - Alphonse de Lamartine
