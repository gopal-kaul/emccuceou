            I started singing like any average Christian child in church ðŸ˜‚.
            When I was in 11th grade I started writing poetry which slowly
            developed into me writing songs and my guitar journey started when I
            was 12 years old. Currently I had one show for my originals thanks
            to the music club, was the founder of the open mic in college and
            currently working on original music to be released soon . Apart from
            this I am also a part time guitar teacher
